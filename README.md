For this project, I started doing the HTML for the mobile first and from there started building the other pages. After that, I started doing the responsive screens with the usual struggles of alignment ad functionality of the burger menu for me. Some parts of the design were very difficult to achieve especially the calendar, which will need to have JS to be fully functional. Also having a search bar only for dates was challenging. Having a calendar and dates is very important for this project because the content is basically based on daily photography which means that having a way to search by date a calendar will provide the user with the tool to navigate efficiently the website. Theres idefinitely room for improvement and fixes.
